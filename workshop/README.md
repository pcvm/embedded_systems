* ReferenceMaterials_books_tutes_cards/
   - Fast Introduction, Overview and Text.

* Compiler_Cheat_Sheets_and_Reference_Cards/
   - Includes an Arduino Cheat Sheet and C language reference card.

* Circuits_and_Diagrams/
   - Photograph of system components and related circuit diagrams.

* Demo_Code_Examples_AVR/
   - Sample programs used in the workshop.

* Demo_Systems_Photographs_AVR
   - Photographs of some of the constructed systems that used te demo code.

* Support Materials:
   - Arduino_Libraries
   - Data_Sheets_AVR_and_LCD
   - Drivers_for_USB-UART_adapters

* Arduino Tools:
   - Visit http://arduino.cc for pre-built versions of the compiler tools bundled with an IDE, downloader, etc. and featuring a well organised library import and contribution system (and also a target CPU extension system).
