It is interesting to get an indea of the IO and chip support in the Arduino
platform and related clones. Try these shell commands which assume
applications are installed in paths such as /Applications/Arduino.app/ and
/Applications/Energia.app/ (adjust for your unix or unix-like environment).

For Arduino (on OS-X):

  find /Applications/Arduino.app/ -name io.h
  more /Applications/Arduino.app//Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/io.h
  ls -l /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/ | more
  ls -l /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/ | grep 328
  more /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/avr/include/avr/iom328p.h

For Energia (on OS-X):

  find /Applications/Energia.app/ -name io.h
  more /Applications/Energia.app//Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/tools/msp430/msp430/include/io.h
  more /Applications/Energia.app//Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/tools/msp430/msp430/include/msp430.h

Note: when displaying include file iom328p.h, notice how all manner of
      important chip parameters are described e.g interrupt vectors, port
      address and port bit names, etc.
