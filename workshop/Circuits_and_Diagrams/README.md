   - Clone circuit diagram

* 06_ATmega_Memory_Map.gif
   - The ATmega memory map shows the address ranges for the Program Memory system (with a boot section), the Data Memory system (including the registers, IO peripherals, and internal static RAM), and the EEPROM.

* 07_AVR_Architecture_-_Controller.png
   - Overview of the AVR chip, showing how the limited pins on the chip have to be multi-functional so that the internal peripherals can connect to the outside world (see note).

* 08_AVR_Architecture_-_CPU.gif
   - Overview of theCPU in the AVR chip.

* 09_Pinouts_ATMega328_PDIP.png
   - Pin definitions for the ATmega328 in a dual in-line package, with Arduino names.
