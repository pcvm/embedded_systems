These references are useful when programming:

* Arduino_Cheat_Sheet-11-12-13.pdf
   - Important functions for use in Arduino programming.

* C Reference Card (ANSI) 2.2.pdf
   - C language reference card (some items are not present in the Arduino C/C++ environment but the language basics are fine).

* Progmem.pdf
   - Notes on how to directly allocate data into the AVR internal flash program memory system (shows how to use some extra compiler directives).

* compile_link_hw_pp.pdf and compile_link_hw_pp.odg
   - Overview of compiling --> linking --> downloading --> running a program.
