The Arduino is a family of microcontroller boards to simplify electronic design, prototyping and experimenting for artists, hackers, hobbyists, but also many professionals.

This little booklet, written by Prof. Jan Borchers, introduces you to using an Arduino. It comes with shopping tips and a SparkFun online wish list to get the parts you'll need.

Book size is 8 x 6 inches. Print at original size (100% scale!) onto larger paper and cut to size outside the cropmarks on the cover. The size is also perfect for reading on an iPad.
