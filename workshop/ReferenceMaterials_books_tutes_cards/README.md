   - The original site is https://www.handsonresearch.org/2012/PDF/IntroductionToArduino.pdf (other details in file IntroductionToArduino_src.txt).
   - From an original announcement: "Digital microprocessor systems are ubiquitous in consumer electronics today, and are found in automobiles, computers, embedded systemts, handheld devices, and smart sensors."
   - Tools: Fritzing (software for drawing circuits)     http://fritzing.org/, Arduino software http://arduino.cc./

* Introduction to Arduino: A Piece of Cake (book)
   - File IntroArduinoBook.pdf
   - This is the current (2016) pdf downloaded from http://www.introtoarduino.com/ for the text "Introduction to Arduino: A Piece of Cake" by Alan Smith, 2011.
   - Book details==> Paperback: 170 pages; Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (August 19, 2011); ISBN-10: 1463698348 or ISBN-13: 978-1463698348.
   - This book is very good (check out the very positive on-line reviews at booksellers) and covers: basic programming; audio output; making a digital thermometer; graphics; use of sensors to detect light, magnets, and knocking; etc.
   - Software is provided at the author's web site, in a zip archive named USBKey.zip (local copy is IntroArduinoBook_software_USBKey.zip).
   - LCD Note: the book and its experiments use a PCD8544 graphics LCD Controller (the driver is provided), and this is different to the LCD attached to the Arduino via the I2C bus.

* For experienced programmers:
