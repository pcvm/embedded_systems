* A Temperature and Humidity Thing 
  - A basic web server providing hygrometer and temperature results from an AM2302 sensor.
  - Using NodeMCU https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0, Adafruit DHT-sensor-library for DHT22/AM2302, and NodeMCU ESP-12 Development Kit.
  - References
     - from https://learn.adafruit.com/dht/connecting-to-a-dhtxx-sensor, the AM2302 is a wired version of the DHT22
     - at https://www.adafruit.com/product/393:
       - "AM2302 is a wired version of the DHT22"
       - has a 5.1K resistor pullup connecting VCC and DATA so external pullup not needed
       - connect pin 1 to 3.3V, pin 2 to GPIO 17, pin3 is NC, and pin 4 is GND
     - top view with mounting surface facing down and bolt hole upper:
       - pins 1234 are left to right as VCC, DATA, NC, GND
  - Before use, enter wifi info for nw_ssid and nw_passwd, rebuild and upload to target hardware.
